	<h2>Welcome to my NC State Page!</h2>
	<!--Number 2 answered above here-->

    <p>My name is <strong>Pierce Whelan</strong> and I am a <ins>Freshman</ins> in the College of Engineering at <em>NC State</em>. Right now, I intend on dual-majoring in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. I chose these majors because I love computers and the hardware within them. In the future, these two majors will help me achieve my goal of improving and/or making computer hardware.</p>    
	<br />
	<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 20px; color: #FF00FF; text-align: center;">Right now, I am a seasonal worker at Target in the SFS (Ship from Store) department. However, my dream job involves me working with computer hardware to improve its design. I consider myself a computer enthusiast and working on computers for a living would be a dream come true.</p>
